# ‚ôüÔ∏è Special Chess Moves Guide

## Overview

The Chess PWA now fully supports **all three special chess moves**:

1. **Castling** - King and rook move together
2. **En Passant** - Special pawn capture
3. **Pawn Promotion** - Pawn reaches the opposite end

## üè∞ Castling

### What is Castling?

A special move involving the king and a rook that haven't moved yet. It's the only move where two pieces move simultaneously.

### How to Castle

1. **Select your king** (must be in starting position)
2. **Legal castling squares highlight in green**:
   - **Kingside**: King moves 2 squares right (to g1/g8)
   - **Queenside**: King moves 2 squares left (to c1/c8)
3. **Click the destination** - both king and rook move automatically!

### Requirements

‚úÖ **King** and **rook** must not have moved  
‚úÖ **No pieces** between king and rook  
‚úÖ **King not in check** currently  
‚úÖ **King doesn't move through check**  
‚úÖ **King doesn't end in check**

### Notation

- **Kingside castling**: `O-O`
- **Queenside castling**: `O-O-O`

### Visual Cues

- When you select the king, castling squares (if legal) will **highlight in green**
- Click the destination square (g1/g8 or c1/c8)
- Both king and rook move automatically in one action!

## üëª En Passant

### What is En Passant?

A special pawn capture that can occur when an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside your pawn.

### How it Works

1. **Opponent moves pawn two squares** forward (e.g., e7 ‚Üí e5)
2. **Your pawn is beside it** on the same rank (e.g., on d5 or f5)
3. **On your very next turn**, you can capture it diagonally as if it had moved only one square

### Example

```
Turn 1: White pawn e2 ‚Üí e4
Turn 2: Black pawn d7 ‚Üí d5
Turn 3: White pawn e4 ‚Üí e5 (moves two squares, landing beside black pawn)
Turn 4: Black pawn d5 ‚Üí e6 (captures white pawn en passant!)
```

### Visual Cues

- When you select your pawn, **en passant squares highlight in green** (if legal)
- The captured pawn disappears from its original square
- Your pawn moves diagonally to an "empty" square

### Important Rules

‚è∞ **Can only capture en passant on the very next turn**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **If you don't capture immediately, you lose the opportunity**

## üëë Pawn Promotion

### What is Pawn Promotion?

When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board (rank 8 for white, rank 1 for black), it **must** be promoted to another piece.

### How to Promote

1. **Move your pawn** to the last rank
2. **Promotion dialog appears automatically**
3. **Choose your piece**:
   - ‚ôï **Queen** (most powerful, most common choice)
   - ‚ôñ **Rook** (good for endgames)
   - ‚ôó **Bishop** (useful in specific positions)
   - ‚ôò **Knight** (can create forks and tactics)
4. **Your pawn transforms immediately!**

### Visual Cues

- Move your pawn to rank 8 (white) or rank 1 (black)
- **Modal dialog appears** with 4 large buttons
- Click your choice - the piece changes instantly!
- Game continues with your new piece

### Strategy Tips

- **Default to Queen** in most cases (most powerful piece)
- **Knight** can be useful for specific tactics (especially forks or checkmates)
- **Rook** is good in endgames with limited pieces
- **Bishop** rarely chosen but can be useful in certain positions
- **You can promote to ANY piece**, even if you still have the original (yes, you can have 2 queens!)

### Notation

Promotion shown with `=` or `/`:
- **Pawn to e8 promotes to queen**: `e8=Q` or `e8Q`
- **Pawn captures and promotes**: `exd8=Q`

## üéÆ How to Execute Special Moves

### In the PWA

All special moves work **automatically**:

1. **Select the piece** you want to move
2. **Legal moves highlight in green** (including special moves!)
3. **Click the destination**
4. **Special move executes automatically**

### Castling Example

```
1. Click white king (e1)
2. See green highlights on g1 (kingside) and c1 (queenside)
3. Click g1
4. King moves to g1, rook automatically moves from h1 to f1!
```

### En Passant Example

```
1. Opponent moves pawn two squares (e.g., e7 ‚Üí e5)
2. On your turn, click your pawn beside it (e.g., d5)
3. See diagonal capture square highlighted (e6)
4. Click e6
5. Your pawn moves to e6, opponent's pawn on e5 disappears!
```

### Pawn Promotion Example

```
1. Click your pawn on rank 7
2. Click rank 8 square
3. Pawn moves, promotion dialog appears
4. Click "Queen" button
5. Pawn transforms to queen!
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Why can't I castle?"

Check these requirements:
- ‚ùì Has your king moved at all this game? (Even if you moved it back, castling is forbidden)
- ‚ùì Has that rook moved?
- ‚ùì Are there pieces between the king and rook?
- ‚ùì Is your king currently in check?
- ‚ùì Would your king move through an attacked square?
- ‚ùì Would your king end up in check?

### "Why can't I capture en passant?"

- ‚ùì Did the opponent's pawn move two squares on their LAST turn?
- ‚ùì Is your pawn on the 5th rank (for white) or 4th rank (for black)?
- ‚ùì Is the opponent's pawn directly beside yours?

**Remember**: En passant can ONLY be done on the immediate next turn!

### "The promotion dialog isn't appearing"

- ‚ùì Did your pawn reach rank 8 (white) or rank 1 (black)?
- ‚ùì Try refreshing the page if it's stuck

## üìä Move Tracking

All special moves are properly recorded in move history:

- **Castling**: Shows as `O-O` or `O-O-O`
- **En Passant**: Shows as normal capture (e.g., `dxe6`)
- **Promotion**: Shows as `e8=Q`, `exd8=N`, etc.

## üéØ Practice Scenarios

### Test Castling

1. Start new game
2. Move: **e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6 Bc4 Bc5**
3. Now **kingside castling** is legal for both sides!
4. Click king ‚Üí click g1 (white) or g8 (black)

### Test En Passant

1. Start new game
2. Move: **e4 d6 e5 f5**
3. Now white can capture **en passant**: click e5 pawn ‚Üí click f6

### Test Promotion

1. Start new game (or use existing game)
2. Advance a pawn to rank 7
3. Move it to rank 8
4. Choose promotion piece from dialog

## üî• Advanced Tips

1. **Castling Early**: Generally good to castle early (moves 3-10) for king safety
2. **Kingside vs Queenside**: Kingside castling is more common and faster to set up
3. **En Passant Tactics**: Can be crucial in pawn endgames - don't forget about it!
4. **Underpromotion**: Promoting to knight (instead of queen) can sometimes deliver checkmate or create a winning fork
5. **Promoted Queens**: Having 2 queens is rare but devastating!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

For developers interested in the internals:

- **Castling tracking**: `pieceMoveTracker` Set stores which pieces have moved
- **En passant detection**: Checks last move was a pawn moving 2 squares
- **Promotion UI**: Modal dialog with 4 buttons, integrates seamlessly with move system
- **Notation**: Special moves properly recorded in `moveHistory`
- **Undo**: All special moves can be undone (coming soon!)
