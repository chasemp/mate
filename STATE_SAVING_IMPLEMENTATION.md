# 💾 State Saving Implementation

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

State saving is now fully operational in Mate Chess PWA! Your games are automatically saved and restored.

---

## 🎯 **What It Does**

Automatically preserves your chess game in browser `localStorage` so you never lose progress.

### **Automatic Triggers:**

✅ **After every move** - Game state saved instantly  
✅ **Before navigation** - Saved when clicking Settings (⚙️)  
✅ **On page load** - Automatically restored when returning  
✅ **Clear on new game** - Old saves removed when starting fresh  
✅ **Auto-expire** - Saves older than 7 days are discarded  

---

## 📦 **What Gets Saved**

Stored in `localStorage` as `'mate-current-game'`:

```javascript
{
  // Board state
  board: [[...], [...], ...],           // 8x8 array of pieces
  
  // Game metadata
  currentTurn: "white",                  // Whose turn
  moveHistory: [{from, to, ...}, ...],   // All moves
  capturedPieces: {white: [], black: []}, // Captured pieces
  gameStatus: "active",                  // active/check/checkmate/stalemate
  gameId: "ab3d",                        // For multiplayer sharing
  
  // AI state (if applicable)
  isAIGame: false,                       // Is this vs Computer?
  aiColor: "black",                      // AI's color
  aiSkillLevel: 10,                      // AI difficulty (0-20)
  
  // Metadata
  savedAt: 1728276911000,                // Timestamp
  pieceMoveTracker: ["7,4", "7,3"]      // For castling rights
}
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Methods Added:**

#### `saveGameState()`
- Serializes game to JSON
- Stores in `localStorage['mate-current-game']`
- Only saves if game has moves (not empty)
- Includes timestamp for expiry checking

#### `restoreGameState()`
- Deserializes from `localStorage`
- Validates age (discards if >7 days old)
- Restores board, moves, AI state
- Shows "Game resumed!" notification

#### `clearSavedGame()`
- Removes saved state from `localStorage`
- Called when starting new games

### **Integration Points:**

1. **After every move** (in `tryMove()`)
2. **Before settings** (in settings button click handler)
3. **On app init** (in constructor after URL check)
4. **On new game** (in `startTwoPlayerGame()` and `startVsAIFromSetup()`)

---

## 🎮 **User Experience**

### **Console Logs:**

When saving:
```
✅ Game state saved: {moves: 2, turn: 'black', gameId: 'ab3d'}
```

When restoring:
```
Restoring saved game: {moves: 2, turn: 'black', savedAt: '10/6/2025, 11:15:11 PM'}
```

When cleared:
```
Saved game cleared
```

### **Notifications:**

- `"✅ Game resumed! (2 moves)"` - When game restored
- `"New 2-player game started! (Game ID: ab3d)"` - Old save cleared
- `"🤖 AI game started! (Level 10)"` - Old save cleared

---

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Never lose progress** - Games survive refreshes, crashes, navigation
2. **Seamless UX** - Automatic, no save button needed
3. **Smart expiry** - Old saves don't clutter storage
4. **Full state** - Everything restored: board, moves, AI settings
5. **PWA-ready** - Works offline, perfect for Progressive Web App
