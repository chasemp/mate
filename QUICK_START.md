## Building for Production

```bash
# Build to /docs directory
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview

# Check the build
ls -la docs/
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

**CRITICAL:** Following Blockdoku pattern - `/docs` is COMMITTED to git!

```bash
# 1. Build the project (generates /docs directory)
npm run build

# 2. Verify build output
ls -la docs/

# 3. Commit BOTH source and build output
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Chess PWA setup"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. Configure GitHub Pages (ONE TIME ONLY)
# Go to: https://github.com/chasemp/chess/settings/pages
# Source: Deploy from a branch
# Branch: main
# Folder: /docs
# Save

# 6. Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit:
# https://chasemp.github.io/chess/
```

**Important:** Unlike some projects, we DO commit `/docs` to git. This is the deployment source for GitHub Pages. The workflow is:

```
Edit /src ‚Üí npm run build ‚Üí /docs generated ‚Üí commit /docs ‚Üí push ‚Üí deployed
```

## Custom Domain Setup (chess.523.life)

```bash
# 1. Create CNAME file
echo "chess.523.life" > public/CNAME

# 2. Configure DNS (at your DNS provider)
# Add CNAME record:
# chess.523.life ‚Üí chasemp.github.io

# 3. Build and deploy
npm run build
git add -A
git commit -m "Add custom domain"
git push origin main

# 4. Configure in GitHub settings
# Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Custom domain: chess.523.life
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
npm run port:kill
npm run dev
```

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules docs
npm install
npm run build
```

### Page Doesn't Load

Check these:
1. Is dev server running? (`npm run dev`)
2. Is port 3458 accessible? (`npm run port:check`)
3. Are you on http://localhost:3458?
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### PWA Not Installing

- Must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Must have valid manifest.json
- Must have valid service worker
- Try on mobile device after deploying

## Next: Start Building!

Now you're ready to start Phase 1 of the roadmap:

1. Open `CHESS_PWA_ROADMAP.md`
2. Start with **Phase 1: Core Chess Engine**
3. Build `board.js` first
4. Test each component as you build it

**Happy coding! ‚ôüÔ∏è**
